  <p class="sofia">Halloween falls on our land once again! The day where we go around houses, knocking on people's doors, and pray they give us some sweet treats. However those sweet treats can be the reason if your Halloween goes the way you wanted to, or fails big time. So, this list here shows the top 10 best candies that you can be able to get this Halloween when you go trick-or-treating, and to possibly use trade with that one kid who always has the goods. With that being said, here are the Top best candies you can recieve this Halloween!</p>
  <h2 style="background-color:tomato;text-align:center;">Honorable Mention:Candy Corn</h2>
  <img src="Images/candy-corn.jpg" width="500" height="333"style="filter: drop-shadow(8px 8px 10px black);">
  <p style="text-align: center;" class="sofia">This may seem a bit of a strech but candy corn is very underated due people not really giving this out. While some people may hate it, candy corn gives a bit of nostalgia when you eat it, you will remember when you were just a child eating these one day and remember that feeling. Most  people will get that feeling, even if they don't eat that much candy corn nowadays. Even still. as a fall treat and an underated cany, it at the very least deserves an honorable mention on this list.</p>
  <h2 style="background-color:tomato;text-align: center;">10.Caramel Apple Pops</h2>
  <img src="Images/carmel-apple.png" width="500" height="333"style="filter: drop-shadow(8px 8px 10px black);">
  <p style="text-align: center;" class="sofia">This is also a very underated candy becuase not that many people have gotten to truly taste this glorius wonder. This is exactly what you think it is. a soft apple lolipop with a creamy chewy filling of caramel inside of it. When you find this in your candy bag, you will experience nothing but pleasure and joy eating this pop. The only reason as to why it is not higher up is because you would only really find one of these in your bag due to not that many people seeing this wonderous joy</p>
  <h2 style="background-color:tomato;text-align: center;">9.Kit-Kats</h2>
<img src="Images/Kit-kat.jpg" width="500" height="333"style="filter: drop-shadow(8px 8px 10px black);">
  <p style="text-align: center;" class="sofia">This has to be one of the pioneers of original halloween candy when this was found in your bag. A nice chocolate bar with wafers in the middle always had you asking for more. Even though this migh be in everyone's bag, it was still in multiple wafers that made you at least happy. Because let's be honest. who truy hates a Kit-Kat?</p>
  <h2 style="background-color:tomato;text-align: center;">8.Baby-Ruth</h2>
  <img src="Images/baby-ruth.jpg" width="500" height="333"style="filter: drop-shadow(8px 8px 10px black);">
  <p style="text-align: center;" class="sofia">This was also one of the candies that you will always find in your candy bag. It has been bursting with peanuts and a nice rich carmel even with some nougat. Finding this in your bag may make you question what type of candy this is. But when you take a bite of it, you will feel nothing but pure bliss.</p>
  <h2 style="background-color:tomato;text-align: center;">7.Sour-Patch Kids</h2>
  <img src="Images/sour-patch.jpg" width="500" height="333"style="filter: drop-shadow(8px 8px 10px black);">
  <p style="text-align: center;" class="sofia">For one of the none-chocolate candies on this list, sour-patch kids have been the most famous non-chocolate candies that you find on your bag. that sour and sweet gummy that all the kids loved, it has always been a wonderous thing for all people to enjoy. Finding these in fun-size puches always made someones day, seeing the bright yellow and green pack with those kids inside.</p>
  <h2 style="background-color:tomato;text-align: center;">6.Twix</h2>
  <img src="Images/Twix.jpg" width="500" height="333"style="filter: drop-shadow(8px 8px 10px black);">
  <p style="text-align: center;" class="sofia">Another candy that can considered to be a pioneer of original halloween candy, this bar of bliss was always an amazing treat to indulge in. The cookie and the caramel in the middle of a nice chocolate outside was always a treat for many. Even seeing a king size version of this has always made a kid's day even more wonderous. Seeing a twix bar will always be a treat to enjoy.</p>
